Code Style:

* Java coding convention

* Class variables are all UPPER_CASE.

* Instant variables start with lowercase letter.

* Try to add comment to complicate method.

* Related methods are grouped together.

* Methods are kept short to improve readability and maintainability.

* Avoid hard-code common String value, instead,  using static variables represent String. For example, use public final static String GET = “GET”, to replace “GET” keyword.


Packcage Info:

* webServer: contains classes that use to sets up web server, and WebServer itself.

* webServer.constants: contains all the constant classes.

* webServer.httpdConfSetter: containts all the classes that is responsible for setting the appropriate value to web server configuration.

* webServer.request: contains all the classes that dealing with client request stream.

* webServer.response: contains all the classes that dealing with response to client request.

* webServer.ulti: contains utility classes that is used through out the project.


Implementation:

* Main method is located in WebServer class.

* I choose not to use BufferedReader or BufferedInputStream to read request input stream because either of them provide the functionality that I need. So I wrote a helper class, ByteInputStreamReader, 
which provide readLine and read bytes functionality.

* Request body is not stored as String, instread, it is store as byte array.

* CGI script path is got from httpd.conf file, if httpd.conf not specific, it will get it from the to be executed script file.

* Log class is used for debug, and it is turned off by default, to see log info, see DEBUG variable in Log class to true.
